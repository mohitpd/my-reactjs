## Create React App
npx create-react-app .

## Start React Application
npm start

## Bundle
React will transpile all the files into a bundle file.

## When we run the development server it is going to search for the src directory.

## By default we need a src/index.js file

## to create react Application:
import React from 'react'
## to connect with index.html:
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'

## we need to build components in react Application
it can be a class or function
it always needs to return some code

## Functional components:
Do all types of Javascript stuffs and then return a jsx.

## class components uses methods to return the jsx.
the jsx is returned inside the render() met

## Use Synthetic events
onClick={()=>this.eventHandler()}

## state
this is an object inside a class component that can store multiple values.
to change a value of a state property we use 
this.setState({
    key: newValue
})

we can pass the state as a parameter to setState:
this.setState((state,props)=>{
    count:state.count+1
})

## props
We can pass functions and data between components back and forward
<NewsList news={this.state.news}/>
 
## Lifecycles:
in class components there are multiple lifecycle methods that can be used to override the process at particular times.

## nextState:
it is the next form of the state

## prevState:
The previous form of the state

## hooks:
it is used to perform many react features without using classes
